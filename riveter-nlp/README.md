# Riveter ðŸ’ª

<br>

Riveter ðŸ’ª is a Python package that measures social dynamics between personas mentioned in a collection of texts.

The package identifies and extracts the subjects, verbs, and direct objects in texts; it performs coreference resolution on the personas mentioned in the texts (e.g., clustering "Elizabeth Bennet" and "she" together as one persona); and it measures social dynamics between the personas by referencing a given lexicon. The package currently includes lexica for Maarten Sap et al's ***connotation frames of power and agency*** and Rashkin et al's ***connotation frames of perspective, effect, value, and mental state***,Â but you can also load your own custom lexicon.

The name Riveter is inspired by ["Rosie the Riveter,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:We_Can_Do_It!.jpg) the allegorical figure who came to represent American women working in factories and at other industrial jobs during World War II. Rosie the Riveter has become an iconic symbol of power and shifting gender roles â€” subjects that the Riveter package aims to help users measure and explore.

## Installation

### Quick start

To skip local installation and get started immediately, you can using [this Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19akZ2Qu7uva8jOsc49e_2HJmDo88WAXm?usp=sharing).

### Requirements 

- Python 3.9
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- spacy-experimental

### Installation instructions

These instructions have been tested on OSX machines. We have not tested these instructions in other environments.

1. We strongly recommend creating a new virtual environment. Activate this environment before installing and before running the code.

```bash
conda create -n riveterEnv python=3.9
conda activate riveterEnv
```

2. Download this repo by using the Git command below or by downloading the repository manually (click the green _Code_ button above, select _Download ZIP_, and then unzip the downloaded directory). 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maartensap/riveter-nlp.git
cd riveter-nlp
```

*Note: If installing on a Mac, you will need Xcode installed to run git from the command line.*

3. Install spacy-experimental and the spaCy model files.
```bash
pip install -U spacy-experimental
pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-experimental/releases/download/v0.6.0/en_coreference_web_trf-3.4.0a0-py3-none-any.whl#egg=en_coreference_web_trf
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

4. Install pandas and seaborn.
```bash
conda install pandas
conda install seaborn
```

## Usage

To use Riveter ðŸ’ª, see the examples in [our demo notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19akZ2Qu7uva8jOsc49e_2HJmDo88WAXm?usp=sharing). 

This notebook includes both toy and realistic examples and all of the most important function calls.

If you want a quick start:
```python
riveter = Riveter()  
riveter.load_sap_lexicon('power')
riveter.train(texts,
             text_ids)
persona_score_dict = riveter.get_score_totals()  
```

*Note: [Here](https://towardsdatascience.com/get-your-conda-environment-to-show-in-jupyter-notebooks-the-easy-way-17010b76e874) are some instructions for how to run `demo.ipynb` from the riveterEnv conda environment that you created during installation.*
